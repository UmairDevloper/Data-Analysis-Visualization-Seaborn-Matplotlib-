# Data Visualization Practice Repository ðŸ“Š

This repository contains my practice and exploration of **data visualization** concepts using Python libraries.  
I have covered both **fundamental** and **advanced** visualizations, explored multiple types of plots, and finally applied them to a hands-on **Netflix Dataset Project**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

### ðŸ”¹ Matplotlib
- Line plots (single and multiple series)
- Scatter plots & bubble charts
- Bar charts (vertical, horizontal, grouped, stacked)
- Pie charts with annotations
- Subplots and figure layout
- Styling (colors, markers, annotations, grid, ticks, etc.)

### ðŸ”¹ Seaborn
- **Distribution Plots**: histogram, KDE, rugplot, displot
- **Categorical Plots**: barplot, countplot, boxplot, violinplot, stripplot, swarmplot
- **Regression & Linear Plots**: regplot, lmplot
- **Matrix Plots**: heatmap, pairplot, clustered heatmaps
- **Relational Plots**: relplot, catplot
- Themes and color palettes

### ðŸ”¹ Plotly & Cufflinks (Interactive Visualizations)
- Interactive line, bar, scatter plots
- Tooltips, hover information, zooming
- Saving interactive visuals as HTML
- Dashboards-ready interactive charts

## ðŸ“Œ Netflix Dataset Project ðŸŽ¬

As a complete project, I worked on **Netflix Titles Dataset** to apply my visualization and analysis skills:

### **Steps Taken**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing with **Pandas**
  - Handling missing values
  - Extracting `top_genre` from `listed_in`
  - Extracting numeric durations from `duration`
  - Parsing `release_year` and `date_added`
- Feature engineering for genres, directors, actors, and type (Movie/TV Show)

### **Visualizations**
- Content releases per year (line chart)
- Most popular genres and their trends over time
- Distribution of movie durations and TV show seasons
- Top 10 directors and actors by number of titles
- Ratings and countries distribution
- Genre vs Release Year heatmaps
- Interactive Plotly visuals for dynamic exploration

### **Insights**
- Growth of Netflix content over years
- Shift in popular genres
- TV Shows vs Movies pattern in terms of durations
- Key players (directors/actors) contributing most titles
- Geographic and ratings-based content analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary
This repository is a **complete playground of data visualization** where I:
- Practiced **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Cufflinks**
- Covered **all major plot categories**: distribution, categorical, regression, matrix, and interactive
- Applied everything on a **real-world dataset (Netflix)** for insights
